@MapGeneration
House can be generated top of player when player enters a biome

@General
Console won't accept input if any other window (or none) is selected when the application starts

@Rendering
When listing inventory, sometimes the scrolling and selection
	go offsync, but sometimes it doesn't. Could be a bug
	in inventory_unique_nth_count, or inventory_unique_item_count
