Some ideas for the project

- Heat stroke (low thirst and high temperature)
	- Could be in the same variable as hypothermia
- Some other 'village' structures (wells, ???)
- Roads in 'villages' that connect the structures together if there
	are enough of them
- Items [Inventory, way to collect stuff, trading, etc.]
- 'Living' entities (friendly and hostile)
	- Cows
