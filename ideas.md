Some ideas for the project

- Heat stroke (low thirst and high temperature)					[x]

- Some other 'village' structures (wells, ???)					[ ]

- Smaller FOV													[ ]

- Stuff in the houses (just random stuff atm)					[ ]

- Roads in 'villages' that connect the structures together if 	[ ]
	there are enough of them			

- Items [Inventory, way to collect stuff, trading, etc.]		[ ]
	- Maybe items could be enumerated by generating a
		.h file from the items/list.txt ????

- 'Living' entities (friendly and hostile)						[ ]
	- Cows														[ ]

	
Items
	ID [i32]
	Name [const char*]
	Metadata [i32]
	Description [const char*]
	Price [i32]
