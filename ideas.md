Some ideas for the project

- Some other 'village' structures (wells, ???)					[ ]
	- Houses should have their own tiles, so temperature
		could be manageable by staying inside
	
- Smaller FOV ???												[ ]

- Stuff in the houses (just random stuff atm)					[ ]

- Roads in 'villages' that connect the structures together if 	[ ]
	there are enough of them			

- Items [Inventory, way to collect stuff, trading, etc.]		[ ]
	- Maybe items could be enumerated by generating a
		.h file from the items/list.txt ????
	- You should be able to scroll the item list, but
		this will only be a problem once we have
		enough items that it won't fit one screen
	- Different selection color depending on the type of
		the item (consumable could be green for example)
		
- 'Living' entities (friendly and hostile)						[ ]
	- Cows														[ ]
	- NPCs
		- Just dummy ones at start, maybe add some logic later
	
- Idea of a 'tick'
	- Some actions take more than others
		- Walking 1, slower walking more(?)
		- Healing (not using potions) takes more
	
- Menu/UI System
		- Dialogue system
		- Panel
		- Option
